REVENT: MASS MOBILIZATION

  The radicalDESIGNS distributed event organizing tool is designed to aid 
  organizers in planning and executing national days of action, house parties, 
  meetups, and other organizing models. The tool is a full featured event 
  planning system that includes host signup, participant RSVP, host management 
  features and extensive report back tools. The tool integrates with Salsa CRM, 
  and supports multiple admin interfaces for multi-member coalition organizting.


Event Tool Features:
 Event Display
  * Geo location and mapping:  All events are geo located and then plotted on a
    series of Flash and Google based maps depending on the current view of the
    event or search.
  * Event Searching:  Users can search for events by date and geographical
    location.
  * Email Triggers:  Customized emails can be sent to event hosts and
    participants after they signup to host or attend an event via DIA and/or the
    rEvent system,.
  * Event Updates:  Hosts have the ability to post ongoing blog style updates
    about the event.
  * File and image attachment:  Event host can upload pictures flyer or other
    files to attache to events.
  * Host Profile Pages:  Events hosts have individual pages that show their
    contact information and a picture.
  * Congressional District Matching:  Events can be mapped to congressional
    district based on their zip code or address.
  * Event Types and Tagging:  Special event types and tags can be created to sort
    and search for events by different criteria.
  * Public/Private Events:  Allow the option for event to be private. Private
    events will be accessible by a direct web address but will not show up on the
    event map or the event search pages.
  * Multiple calendars for different simultaneous mobilizations.

Event Report Back System
  Users and event hosts can report back on the outcome of events. The report back
  tool includes user narratives, photo uploads with Flickr integration and
  slideshows, YouTube vide integration, press coverage reporting, and mapping of
  event reports. The report back tool also includes a javascript power badge for
  embedding featured report backs on other websites.

Event Host Management Tools
  Event hosts have the ability to log into the tool and manage all aspects of their
  event. Host can update event information, manage their profile, view and email
  event participants, invite other event participants, and attach images and
  documents. Event host can also manage event report back information.

Administrator Management Tools
  System administrators will be able to view edit and manage all events and reset
  user passwords.

Salsa CRM Database Integration 
  All users and event data will be mirrored into DIA. This data includes event
  information, event hosting, event attendance and user profiles. DIA trigger
  emails can also be called from the event system. *(subscription to DIA required)


REVENT SETUP

Mass mobilizations can create a significant amount of load.  If you are expecting 
a large turnout, it is sugested that you have at least three servers: a caching 
server, one or more application servers, and db server.

caching server:
- install varnish

application server:
- install ruby 1.8.7
- install apache
- install passenger
- install revent (instructions below)

db server:
- install mysql
- install memcached
- install shortline


WARNING: if rails, varnish, and mysql are unfamilar technologies, it is STRONGLY recomended that you DO NOT HOST REVENT YOURSELF.  There is only a brief window of success for a national day of action, and a server failure could cripple all of the hard work you have done to organize your event. 

Again: DO NOT HOST REVENT YOURSELF UNLESS YOU HAVE BOTH AN EXPERIENCED REVENT DEVELOPER AND AN EXPERIENCED MYSQL DB ADMIN.
